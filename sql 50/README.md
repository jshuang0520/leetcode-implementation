# WITH statement - temp table
‚ùå No, you cannot use multiple separate WITH statements in a single SQL query
‚úÖ Instead, you should combine them into one WITH clause, separating multiple CTEs with commas:
WITH tbl_start AS (
    SELECT machine_id, process_id, timestamp
    FROM Activity
    WHERE activity_type = 'start'
), tbl_end AS (
    SELECT machine_id, process_id, timestamp
    FROM Activity
    WHERE activity_type = 'end'
)


# LAG function
LAG(column_1) OVER (ORDER BY column_2) AS col_alias


# DATEDIFF
-- to find "yesterday": DATEDIFF(...) = 1
DATEDIFF(recordDate, previous_Date) = 1

DATEDIFF(date1, date2) = date1 - date2 (in days)
DATEDIFF('2025-04-19', date) = '2025-04-19' - date (in days)  # we need the single quote for the date itself

# (bonus IS NULL) ‚â† (bonus = NULL)
ü§Ø Why is that?
‚úÖ bonus IS NULL
This is the correct way to check for a NULL value.

‚ùå bonus = NULL
This always results in UNKNOWN, not TRUE, even if bonus is NULL.

üîç Here's why ‚Äî Three-Valued Logic in SQL
SQL uses three-valued logic:

- TRUE

- FALSE

- UNKNOWN


‚úÖ Correct Comparisons with NULL

Expression	Result
- bonus IS NULL	TRUE / FALSE

- bonus = NULL	UNKNOWN

- bonus != NULL	UNKNOWN

- bonus IS NOT NULL	TRUE / FALSE

# how to find if a keyword is not in a column which its schema is VARCHAR?
‚úÖ 1. NOT LIKE for partial match
‚úÖ 2. NOT IN for exact match
‚úÖ 3. Use IS NULL to cover nulls too
WHERE column_name NOT LIKE '%math%' AND column_name IS NOT NULL

# how to select an odd-number id?
WHERE id % 2 = 1

# if given a date, how should I join this row to the corresponding time period?

JOIN Prices AS p
  ON u.product_id = p.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date


üîπ Why Use ON + AND in JOIN?
When you're doing a JOIN, the ON clause defines how the two tables relate to each other ‚Äî that is, the condition for matching rows.



üîç Analogy: ON is the join's WHERE clause
It helps to think of this:

ON = "only combine rows from both tables when this condition is true"

The AND just lets you add more conditions to the same JOIN.


# Methods for Replacing NULLs

‚úÖ IFNULL(SUM(p.price * u.units), 0) / NULLIF(SUM(u.units), 0), 

‚úÖ COALESCE(expr1, expr2, ..., exprN) returns the first non-NULL value from the list of expressions.
e.g., COALESCE(bonus, 0)


# when the query result is a scalar, how to bring it out?
Q: I would like to bring a single value, total_user_num, for further use, and there is no chance to do the join operation, what should I do to successfully use this value in the future query?

‚úÖ Option 1: Use a Scalar Subquery (Cleanest for Your Case)

‚úÖ Option 2: Use a CROSS JOIN (only if you must use a CTE)
üîπ CROSS JOIN adds the scalar total_user_num to every row ‚Äî no matching needed.

# notes to SELECT a subquery
SELECT 
  contest_id, 
--   ROUND((COUNT(1) / SELECT COUNT(1) FROM Users) * 100, 2)*100 AS percentage
-- # we need another set of brackets to do the subquery
  ROUND((COUNT(1) / (SELECT COUNT(1) FROM Users)) * 100, 2) AS percentage  

# notes to ORDER BY
-- ORDER BY (percentage DESC), (contest_id ASC)
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id ASC


# types of variables

Variable | Syntax | Scope | Persistence | Use Case
@var | @var = val | Session | Until disconnect | Temp value in session
DECLARE var | Inside block | Local | Limited to the block | Stored procedures/functions

## session variable: @

‚úÖ In MySQL, you can declare and use variables like this:
üîπ 1. Assigning a value to a variable:
SET @total_users = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users);
Now @total_users holds the count of users.

üîê Is @x Global or Local?

Property	Explanation
Local?	‚ùå No ‚Äî it's not block-scoped (like inside a procedure or a script section)
Global?	‚ùå No ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt affect other sessions
Session?	‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî persists in your current session only

‚ö†Ô∏è Impacts & Cautions

Safe in simple scripts: You can use them in scripts (e.g., in MySQL Workbench, or CLI) to store intermediate values.
Not thread-safe: In multi-user apps (e.g., web apps), avoid relying on @ variables ‚Äî use local variables inside procedures or transactions instead.
Won‚Äôt persist if you disconnect: Once you close your session/connection, the variable is gone.


## local variable (only in stored procedures):

DECLARE total_users INT;
SET total_users = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users);

But this only works inside:
- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- BEGIN...END blocks

# how to concat results vertically (vertical concatenation)?

e.g. 

result 1:

id
--
1
2

result 2:

id
--
3

after concat:

final result:

id
--
1
2
3

‚úÖ Use UNION or UNION ALL
üîπ If you want unique values only (no duplicates):
SELECT id FROM table1
UNION
SELECT id FROM table2;

- This removes duplicates.
- Sort order is not guaranteed unless you add ORDER BY.

üîπ If you want to keep all values including duplicates:

SELECT id FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT id FROM table2;

- Faster than UNION (no deduplication).
- Returns all rows.
