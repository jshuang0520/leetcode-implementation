# ‚úÖ Full Logical Processing Order (with JOINs included)

Here's a more complete version of SQL's logical processing steps:

1. FROM  
2. JOIN / ON  
3. WHERE  
4. GROUP BY  
5. HAVING  
6. SELECT  
7. DISTINCT  
8. ORDER BY  
9. LIMIT / OFFSET

> ‚ùó **Important:** the order of execution for each sql statement
```sql
6. SELECT
7. DISTINCT

1. FROM
2. JOIN / ON
3. WHERE

4. GROUP BY
5. HAVING

8. ORDER BY
9. LIMIT / OFFSET
```

## ‚õÑ WITH statement - create temp table(s)

‚ùå No, you cannot use multiple separate WITH statements in a single SQL query  
‚úÖ Instead, you should combine them into one WITH clause, separating multiple CTEs with commas:

```sql
WITH tbl_start AS (
    SELECT machine_id, process_id, timestamp
    FROM Activity
    WHERE activity_type = 'start'
), tbl_end AS (
    SELECT machine_id, process_id, timestamp
    FROM Activity
    WHERE activity_type = 'end'
)
```

---

## üîÄ LAG function

```sql
LAG(column_1) OVER (ORDER BY column_2) AS col_alias
```

for example:
```sql
SELECT id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        id, 
        temperature, 
        LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS lag_temp
    FROM Weather
) AS T
WHERE temperature > lag_temp;
```

---

## üìÖ date operation

### DATEDIFF

To find "yesterday":

```sql
DATEDIFF(recordDate, previous_Date) = 1
```

```sql
DATEDIFF(date1, date2) = date1 - date2 (in days)
DATEDIFF('2025-04-19', date) = '2025-04-19' - date
```

Remember to wrap literal dates in single quotes.


### DATE_SUB

```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) AS yesterday
FROM your_table;
```


## üìÖ Join with a time period

```sql
JOIN Prices AS p
  ON u.product_id = p.product_id
 AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
```

---

## üß† Why Use ON + AND in JOIN?

Think of `ON` as the **join's WHERE clause** ‚Äî it defines how to match rows:

```sql
JOIN table2
  ON table1.id = table2.id
 AND table1.date BETWEEN ...
```

---

## NULL handling

### syntax ("IS" NULL) ‚â† ("=" NULL)

ü§Ø (WHERE col IS NULL) ‚â† (WHERE col = NULL)

| Expression        | Result   |
|------------------|----------|
| bonus IS NULL     | ‚úÖ TRUE/FALSE |
| bonus = NULL      | ‚ùå UNKNOWN |
| bonus != NULL     | ‚ùå UNKNOWN |
| bonus IS NOT NULL | ‚úÖ TRUE/FALSE |


### üõ†Ô∏è Replacing NULLs

- IFNULL(query, the_value_to_fill_if_null)
```sql
IFNULL(SUM(p.price * u.units), 0) / NULLIF(SUM(u.units), 0)
```

- COALESCE(expr1, ..., exprN) returns the first non-NULL value
```sql
COALESCE(expr1, expr2, ..., exprN)
-- returns the first non-NULL value
-- e.g. COALESCE(bonus, 0)
```

---

## keyword matching in a certain pattern

üîç Finding Keywords in a VARCHAR Column

- ‚úÖ `NOT LIKE '%math%'` ‚Äî partial match  
- ‚úÖ `NOT IN ('math')` ‚Äî exact match  
- ‚úÖ Add `IS NOT NULL` if needed

```sql
WHERE column_name NOT LIKE '%math%' AND column_name IS NOT NULL
```

---

## math operation

üìâ Select odd-numbered IDs

```sql
WHERE id % 2 = 1
```

---

## apply a scalar result into other queries

### üì§ 1. Using scalar subqueries (when JOIN not possible)

#### **Option 1**: scalar subquery in SELECT

```sql
SELECT
  contest_id,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage
FROM Register
GROUP BY contest_id;
```

#### **Option 2**: CROSS JOIN a one-row (scalar result) CTE

```sql
WITH total_usr AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_user_num FROM Users
)
SELECT r.contest_id, COUNT(*) / t.total_user_num AS percentage
FROM Register AS r
CROSS JOIN total_usr AS t
GROUP BY r.contest_id;
```

### üì§ 2. make use of [variables](#variables-in-mysql)

## Variables in MySQL

üß† Variables in MySQL
- session variable
- local variable
- global variable

| Type       | Syntax                  | Scope     | Persistence         | Use Case                        |
|------------|-------------------------|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `@var`     | `SET @var = value`      | Session   | Until disconnect     | Ad-hoc or scripting              |
| `DECLARE`  | In BEGIN...END block    | Local     | Procedure lifetime   | Stored procedures, triggers     |

### session variable: @

‚úÖ In MySQL, you can declare and use variables like this:
üîπ 1. Assigning a value to a variable:
```sql
SET @total_users = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users);
Now @total_users holds the count of users.
```

üîê Is @x Global or Local?

| Property | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local?   | ‚ùå No ‚Äî it's not block-scoped (like inside a procedure or a script section) |
| Global?  | ‚ùå No ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt affect other sessions                                     |
| Session? | ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî persists in your current session only                               |


‚ö†Ô∏è Impacts & Cautions

- Safe in simple scripts: You can use them in scripts (e.g., in MySQL Workbench, or CLI) to store intermediate values.
- Not thread-safe: In multi-user apps (e.g., web apps), avoid relying on @ variables ‚Äî use local variables inside procedures or transactions instead.
- Won‚Äôt persist if you disconnect: Once you close your session/connection, the variable is gone.


### local variable (only in "stored procedures", "triggers", and "BEGIN...END blocks"):

```sql
DECLARE total_users INT;
SET total_users = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users);
```

But this only works inside:
- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- BEGIN...END blocks

## üîó Vertical Concatenation (UNION)
üì§ how to concat results vertically (vertical concatenation)?
‚úÖ Use UNION or UNION ALL

### Example Input and Output for Vertical Concatenation

for example,

Input

| Result 1 |
|----------|
| id       |
| 1        |
| 2        |

| Result 2 |
|----------|
| id       |
| 3        |

Expected Output (concat vertically)

| Final Result |
|---------------|
| id            |
| 1             |
| 2             |
| 3             |

Example:

```sql
SELECT id FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT id FROM table2
ORDER BY id;
```

- conclusion
  - ‚úÖ `UNION` ‚Üí slower, removes duplicates, not sorted (unless you add ORDER BY)
  - ‚úÖ `UNION ALL` ‚Üí faster, returns all rows


### UNION
üîπ If you want unique values only (no duplicates):
```sql
SELECT id FROM table1
UNION
SELECT id FROM table2;
```

- This removes duplicates.
- Sort order is not guaranteed unless you add ORDER BY.

### UNION ALL
üîπ If you want to keep all values including duplicates:

```sql
SELECT id FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT id FROM table2;
```

- Faster than UNION (no deduplication).
- Returns all rows.
